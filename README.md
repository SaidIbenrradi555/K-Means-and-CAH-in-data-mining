# K-Means
## Overview
K-Means is a clustering algorithm used in data mining to partition a given dataset into K clusters. It is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used to identify patterns in data. The algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center, and updates the center to the mean of all the data points in the cluster.

## How it works
Select K initial centroids randomly from the data points.<br>
Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance.<br>
Recalculate the centroid of each cluster by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.<br>
Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence, which occurs when the centroids no longer change or the maximum number of iterations is reached.<br>
## Advantages and disadvantages
### Advantages:

Fast and efficient algorithm for clustering large datasets.<br>
Simple to understand and easy to implement.<br>
Works well with numerical data and can handle missing values.<br>
### Disadvantages:

Sensitive to the initial selection of centroids and can get stuck in local minima.<br>
The number of clusters K needs to be specified beforehand.<br>
Not suitable for categorical data or data with outliers.<br>
## When to use K-Means
K-Means is commonly used when:

There is a large amount of data to cluster.<br>
The number of clusters is known or can be estimated.<br>
The data is numeric and continuous.<br>
## Real-world applications
K-Means has been used in a variety of fields, including:

Customer segmentation in marketing.<br>
Image segmentation in computer vision.<br>
Data compression in signal processing.<br>
Anomaly detection in cybersecurity.<br>
# CAH
## Overview
CAH (Complete-linkage Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering) is another clustering algorithm used in data mining to group similar data points into clusters. The algorithm starts by considering each data point as a separate cluster, and then repeatedly merges the two closest clusters until all the data points belong to one cluster.

## How it works
Start with each data point as a separate cluster.<br>
Calculate the distance between each pair of clusters.<br>
Merge the two closest clusters.<br>
Repeat steps 2-3 until all data points belong to one cluster.<br>
## Advantages and disadvantages
### Advantages:

Produces a hierarchical tree structure that can be visualized.<br>
Can handle different types of distance metrics.<br>
Does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.<br>
### Disadvantages:

Can be computationally expensive for large datasets.<br>
Sensitive to noise and outliers.<br>
Produces a binary tree that can be difficult to interpret.<br>
## When to use CAH
CAH is commonly used when:

The data contains a hierarchical structure.<br>
The number of clusters is not known or cannot be estimated.<br>
The data contains outliers.<br>
## Real-world applications
CAH has been used in a variety of fields, including:

Bioinformatics to cluster genes based on expression data.<br>
Social network analysis to cluster individuals based on their connections.<br>
Image segmentation in computer vision.<br>
Market segmentation in marketing.<br>
